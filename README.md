<h1> Google BI Project </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project has been completed as a requirement in the Google business intelligence professional certificate program. Here, I played the role of a newly hired BI professional at Cyclistic (a fictitious company providing shared bikes). The first task was to present a report to management on how their customers use their bikes and the demand at the different locations. Then I had to combine data from multiple sources (tables) into one table and use that to develop a dashboard and reports for the management using SQL Code, BigQuery and Tableau. The final task was to design a BI dashboard to answer the questions raised in the fictitious scenario.

<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- <b>SQL for ETL operation </b> 

<h2>Tools and Libraries Used</h2>

- <b>Google BigQuery for extracting, transforming and loading data into a final destination </b>
- <b>Tableau for creating visualizations and Dashboards using the final data </b>
